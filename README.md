# ðŸ§Š 3D Stacked Cubes with Python

A simple and fun project that shows how to create and render **3D cubes** in Python using `matplotlib`.  
The script builds three cubes stacked on top of each other, each with its own color.  

Because the cube vertices are written in **homogeneous coordinates**, itâ€™s also a good starting point if you want to play around with transformations like **rotation, scaling, or translation**.

## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s Inside
- A cube generator that works in 3D.
- Different colors, edges, and transparency for each cube.
- A 3D plot you can rotate and explore interactively.
- High-quality `.png` export of your cubes.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
Youâ€™ll need Python and these packages:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
